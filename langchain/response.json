I'm pretty satisfied with it.","title":"Great phone"},{"asin":"B09MW19JW2","product":"SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Ultra Cell Phone","rating":"5.0","source":"amazon","text":"This phone is effectively a version of the note series that samsung discontinued, with the exception of being more powerful than ever. Idle battery lets the phone stay in performance setting for 24 hours and the battery is persistent even when you are running heavy graphic games. The most stunning part of this phone is the camera that captures up to 100 times resolution. This means you can literally make something that is smaller than the size of a tennis ball far away fit the entirety of the camera screen. This is on par if not more powerful than military grade binoculars. 100 times camera pointed to the moon makes it effectively a low resolution telescope.Small downside for those who like to leave their phone running apps for hours, every once in a while (I have experienced this three times since buying the phone Sep 2022) when running large apps the phone may heat up. Since earlier models were known to have caused fires under extreme use, you may want to turn off the phone for a few minutes to let it cool off.","title":"Just an amazing phone.

I was that impressed with the camera. Aside from that, there isn't much of an upgrade over my Note 10+.The Note 10+ is going on 3 years old, and rumors say the next device will have all rounded corners. I don't like that design, and that was reason I chose to buy this.The glass seems more fragile than previous versions. My wife had hers for a week before dropping it less than 2 feet, while using a protective case and the screen cracked, looking like a spider web.The buttons moving to the right, and s pen moving to the left, isn't a problem, though I'd like to know the why behind it.I have no opinion on battery life, as charging phones is so easy, I just don't care.There is something different in the charging design though. My note 10+ with thick cases could still fast charge in my charging stand. The 22 ultra, using the same charging stand, and same brand and style of thick case will not.I have had no issues with camera lag, overheating, fingerprint scanner, or any of the other complaints I've read about.","title":"The new Samsung note."},{"asin":"B09MW19JW2","product":"SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Ultra Cell Phone","rating":"5.0","source":"amazon","text":"If you put a screen shield on - which I would not think of leaving off on this expensive a phone, the finger print reader is useless.  Face recognition is scary good.The battery life is fair - I sure wish it was replaceable which it eventually goes.The cameras are really first class - and compete AMAZINGLY with a typical pocket camera, leaving those to be useless now.I ended up giving up my LG V20 which I loved - and had a replaceable battery - because LG went out of the phone business - and not support or updates.  It had a great finger print reader because it was on the back - exposed - and where you  want one anyway.

I'm a web developer and I need a snappy phone that runs the latest and greatest, as well as provides me with mobile internet access all the time, and this phone does not disappoint.  The cameras are also amazing, even compared to my old s20 FE. A great addition that I didn't expect to be so handy is the S-pen. It's great for jotting down quick notes, doodling at random, editing screenshots, etc. It even has music controls so that you can take the pen and control your music if you are one to plug your phone into a hi-fi away from your desk and such. If that's not your thing, it's nice to have extra tools sometimes when you need them, even if you don't use them often. The screen is also stunning even in comparison to my S20 FE, much brighter, sharper, and overall very color-accurate.  Battery life is also great, and if I needed to I feel like I could get 2 days of power out of the battery without needing to plug in again. Hats off Samsung!

I had been using an S9 and it was starting to act up. There really is no comparison. The S22 Ultra is so much better all around. It's bigger and somewhat bulky though by the time you put it in a case. Supposed to have super fast charging but no wall or car charger comes with it. Just a cable with a C port on each end that I can't use yet because all my wall and car chargers have USB ports. Even my cars built in charging ports take USB cables and it's a Subaru Crosstrek bought brand new in 2019. Seems petty on Samsung's part to not include a charger to fit the included cable.

The S22 Ultra delivers the quality and performance I expect from these flagship devices and I am confident that I may carry on with my tradition after having the S22 Ultra in hand for just over a month now.It comes with all the bells and whistles you'd expect, including a fantastic battery life and then some. One of Samsung's most underrated features, Samsung Dex is a joy to use with this phone. It's quick and snappy through the multitasking capabilities and certainly has been a time saver during some situatuions of technical difficulties.

And after the S4, I bought other brands. This year I decided to give Samsung another try - big mistake. I bought the s22 ultra, after watching numerous youtubers praising the battery life of the phone. After owning the phone for a month, it is clear to me that the Samsung paid a lot of youtubers to lie about the performance of this phone. The phone looks great (besides the curved screen) and it has an awesome OS, with tons of customizations. But the battery life is really, really bad. The 1st phone`s battery was not lasting more than 4, 5 hours, with light usage. It is true that I was using everything, 120ghz refresh rate, always on display, etc. After a few days, I called Samsung support and while on the phone with them, the battery went from 17% to 4% in 7 minutes. They decided that the phone is defective (without running any tests) and told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Once I got the replacement, I optimized everything on the phone: 60ghz refresh rate, low brightness, no Bluetooth, no 5G,  and pretty much  everything else that I could think of, to make sure I'm getting a better battery life. All this increased the battery life, but not enough. I was not using most of the features of the phone and I was still worried that I need to be close to an outlet.  The fingerprint reader is just not working properly, it failed to recognize my prints all the time ( I didn't have a screen protector). And the phone is running SUPERHOT!!! On a call-hot, watching a video-hot, charging -burning hot, in my pocket-hot. I decided to send it back and I will never buy a Samsung product again.I bought another Android device from a different manufacturer and what a change... not running hot, a day and a half battery, 25 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%.","title":"I will never buy a Samsung product again"},{"asin":"B09MW19JW2","product":"SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Ultra Cell Phone","rating":"5.0","source":"amazon","text":"Believe it or not the phone does not come with a block to charge it and you can not use a usb one!

I spent at least $200 trying to find the perfect case and screen protector for my 4-5 year, $1271 investment only to have it give me the black screen of death on day 29. I called Samsung who sent me to UbreakIfixit. They pronounced my phone d.o.a. Samsung then played hot potato after telling me it would cost me to have them service the phone. I then called Amazon only for them to try to shift it to Samsung. Samsung had already told me about the 30 day Amazon money back guarantee. The Amazon rep tried to say it had been more than 30 days when I called them on day 30. Now I am stuck waiting for UPS to pick up the dead phone to process a full refund. It has been 3 days now. My local UPS driver did not have the shipping label on day 1. They didn't bother to show on day 2. What a world!I have never been let down by Samsung before. By far my worst experience with any phone! I am even thinking of switching to Apple now. As much of a Note/Android/Samsung fanatic I have been over the years, I am not sure what to do next.

I like the unique color & appreciate curved screens so no major complaints. Phone is not perfect but is a good purchase when on sale.Pros:\u2022 Cameraso Super saturated colors which may not be for eveyrone but I really prefer them.o Was not sure why there were 2 zoom cameras but the results are fantastic. The pics from far away come out usable.o Softskin on both cameras, not just the selfie.o A slight downside is the quirky camera switching when getting closer to an object. This recenters the picture which can be annoying.\u2022 Screeno OLED screen is bright and colorfulo Curved screens may not be for everyone but I really like them; this is not quite the dramatic waterfall displays of 2020 phones but still curved enough to add some flair.o 4k screen is sharp. I leave it on 4k even though it uses more battery because I figure I paid extra for all those pixels so might as well use them.\u2022 Burgundy Color is not as vibrant as I had hoped but still pleasant overall. Makes the phone standout from the crowd.\u2022 Wide variety of cases & accessories available.Cons:\u2022 Bloatwareo Setting up the phone was much harder than other Android phones I have owned as it keeps trying to get you to create a Samsung account and did not transfer everything from the Google backup, which is what I am used to.o So many unnecessary duplicate Samsung apps that you cannot uninstall.o Several MicroSoft ones too due to their partnership.\u2022 Weight is on the hefty side and can sag down your shorts/pants.\u2022 No charging block included which is baffling considering the price.\u2022 Wifio It does not always connect so sometimes I have to manually tell it to connect or turn wifi off & back on for it work.o Even you tell it cellular preferred, the phone always uses wifi calling when available.\u2022 Bluetooth connection to my car has a lot of weird background noises that I have not experienced with any of my other phones.\u2022 Phone will do this weird thing where when you call someone, it connects but you do not hear the other person. A reboot fixes this issue but it happens every few days which is annoying. Not sure if this is Samsung or T-Mobile issue tho mind you.\u2022 Microphoneo Cannot turn off for just the camera/video like my other phones. You have to pull down the shade and turn it off completely which will then give you pop up warnings that it is off and you cannot do things like make calls.o If you are on a phone call using the microphone, you are not able to take videos which is something my other phones would allow.o In fact, other phones had a button right on the camera screen which allowed you to easily turn the microphone off which would have been nice as it makes the video file smaller.So-So:\u2022 Pricey but it has come down after a year.\u2022 Battery life is OK but definitely uses a lot more power than any other phone I have had. Will still get you through a day of light use but I am not used to dipping below 50% in a 24 hour period.\u2022 One UI skin is not terrible but prefer stock Androido Phone does unnecessary beeps when making & ending a call.o Lock screen notifications are not as detailed making you have have to open them to read more.o No call screening.","title":"Great Cameras & Screen"},{"asin":"B09MW19JW2","product":"SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Ultra Cell Phone","rating":"1.0","source":"amazon","text":"I bought this product 6 months ago.
