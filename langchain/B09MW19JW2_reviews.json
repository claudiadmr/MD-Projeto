{"text": "This phone is effectively a version of the note series that samsung discontinued, with the exception of being more powerful than ever. Idle battery lets the phone stay in performance setting for 24 hours and the battery is persistent even when you are running heavy graphic games. The most stunning part of this phone is the camera that captures up to 100 times resolution. This means you can literally make something that is smaller than the size of a tennis ball far away fit the entirety of the camera screen. This is on par if not more powerful than military grade binoculars. 100 times camera pointed to the moon makes it effectively a low resolution telescope.Small downside for those who like to leave their phone running apps for hours, every once in a while (I have experienced this three times since buying the phone Sep 2022) when running large apps the phone may heat up.

I don't like that design, and that was reason I chose to buy this.The glass seems more fragile than previous versions. My wife had hers for a week before dropping it less than 2 feet, while using a protective case and the screen cracked, looking like a spider web.The buttons moving to the right, and s pen moving to the left, isn't a problem, though I'd like to know the why behind it.I have no opinion on battery life, as charging phones is so easy, I just don't care.There is something different in the charging design though. My note 10+ with thick cases could still fast charge in my charging stand.

It's great for jotting down quick notes, doodling at random, editing screenshots, etc. It even has music controls so that you can take the pen and control your music if you are one to plug your phone into a hi-fi away from your desk and such. If that's not your thing, it's nice to have extra tools sometimes when you need them, even if you don't use them often. The screen is also stunning even in comparison to my S20 FE, much brighter, sharper, and overall very color-accurate.

{"text": "I owned the first 4 Samsung S phones and I`ve always felt like the devices were not very good. And after the S4, I bought other brands. This year I decided to give Samsung another try - big mistake. I bought the s22 ultra, after watching numerous youtubers praising the battery life of the phone. After owning the phone for a month, it is clear to me that the Samsung paid a lot of youtubers to lie about the performance of this phone. The phone looks great (besides the curved screen) and it has an awesome OS, with tons of customizations. But the battery life is really, really bad. The 1st phone`s battery was not lasting more than 4, 5 hours, with light usage. It is true that I was using everything, 120ghz refresh rate, always on display, etc. After a few days, I called Samsung support and while on the phone with them, the battery went from 17% to 4% in 7 minutes. They decided that the phone is defective (without running any tests) and told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Once I got the replacement, I optimized everything on the phone: 60ghz refresh rate, low brightness, no Bluetooth, no 5G,  and pretty much  everything else that I could think of, to make sure I'm getting a better battery life. All this increased the battery life, but not enough. I was not using most of the features of the phone and I was still worried that I need to be close to an outlet.  The fingerprint reader is just not working properly, it failed to recognize my prints all the time ( I didn't have a screen protector). And the phone is running SUPERHOT!!! On a call-hot, watching a video-hot, charging -burning hot, in my pocket-hot. I decided to send it back and I will never buy a Samsung product again.I bought another Android device from a different manufacturer and what a change... not running hot, a day and a half battery, 25 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%.", "title": "I will never buy a Samsung product again", "rating": "2.0"},

{"text": "As I Galaxy Note fan since the Note 2, I finally decided to upgrade from my beloved Note 8 to the Ultra 22. I am sooooo glad I did not trade my phone! The Ultra 22 started out promising with zest and a premium feel. I spent at least $200 trying to find the perfect case and screen protector for my 4-5 year, $1271 investment only to have it give me the black screen of death on day 29. I called Samsung who sent me to UbreakIfixit. They pronounced my phone d.o.a. Samsung then played hot potato after telling me it would cost me to have them service the phone. I then called Amazon only for them to try to shift it to Samsung. Samsung had already told me about the 30 day Amazon money back guarantee. The Amazon rep tried to say it had been more than 30 days when I called them on day 30. Now I am stuck waiting for UPS to pick up the dead phone to process a full refund. It has been 3 days now. My local UPS driver did not have the shipping label on day 1. They didn't bother to show on day 2. What a world!I have never been let down by Samsung before. By far my worst experience with any phone! I am even thinking of switching to Apple now. As much of a Note/Android/Samsung fanatic I have been over the years, I am not sure what to do next.

I ditched the launcher since it was behind in customization compared to oxygenos. I especially hate having to use Samsung's app store to download additional apps that COULD HAVE BEEN BAKED INTO THE SETTINGS AND OS...
