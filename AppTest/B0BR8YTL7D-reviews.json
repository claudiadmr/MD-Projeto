When I found this watch I thought it looked really smart and after reading all the information and the reviews I ordered it. I have only had it 5 days and I am delighted. It was easy to download the App and then pair the watch. I only had one slight query and emailed Customer Service who were brilliant and told me what I needed to do. If you want a smart watch but don\u2019t want to spend a lot then go for this one and you wont be disappointed."

Looks absolutely beautiful (got lots of compliments), very well made and has got all the features what I need. Arrived very quickly, well packaged, the set up was easy and straightforward, works very well with the app. Phonecalls (in and out) are brilliant (crystal clear sounds). The battery lasts for at least 6 days (I'll review this after few months). Overall I am very happy with my purchase, very good value for the money."

Step counter is so accurate, love how the food record works and I set the alarm to remind me to drink water and this has really helped me manage that. Honestly have no complaints!"
