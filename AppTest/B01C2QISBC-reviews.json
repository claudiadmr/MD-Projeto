Mountain ranges, Night time dance floors, selfies with the Mrs on the riverside.Im not a photographer and couldn't tell you what 90% of the setting do but with this little camera ive managed to take some really breathtaking shots that will be going up on my wall that i would of never been able to do with my phone.Took it up a glacier, on boats, to tango festivals and weddings and its a rock solid bit of kit with the case.Being able to charge it with the USB was a life saver, And uploading all my photos to my laptop was a breeze. Id recommend getting a 64gb card if you are planning on doing any videos. And getting the case with it is a 100% must if your the adventurous sort.This camera will be coming with me all over the world :D"

Very happy with it.Auto focus is a bit slow and ponderous but I can live with it.It\u2019s a decent \u201ccheaper\u201d option. No 4K but I\u2019m not bothered about that personally.Picture quality is good, sound quality is very good. In built mic only but it\u2019s of a decent standard.Very happy overall."

The canon g7x mk2 is outstanding for me now everything is close at hand for me. I use a tripod infront of the wheelchair. I can now use my left hand without having to hold the camera. Because its touchscreen you can move the viewfinder up and down makes it easier for me. The most important things for me are apature depth of field and iso.evething the camera has to offer me!"
