            "Positive characteristics": "bought for a camera easy to use, fast delivery and very good value for money, really cant complain, Thought id give amazon brand a go as opposed to my usual scandisk micro cards.Excellent price,work geat, My dash cam was working fine and then prompted me with ‚Äúmemory card error‚Äù. The memory card installed in the dash cam and worked straight out the box without anything extra required. It also came with a full size sd card adapter so you can plug this into a device now like a laptop with an SD card reader to transfer your data.It comes well packaged and protected and the price was not bad at all.I would certainly buy another., Very good, Thank you, 128 Gigabites is a lit of space.",
            "Negative characteristics": "After 3-4 months, of moderate usage in my Steamdeck, went to play a game one morning and the SD card just wasn‚Äôt being recognised in Windows or SteamOS, tried putting it in my DLSR, same thing, didn‚Äôt work, same with my laptop. Seems to be quite hit and miss experience wise though., Returned item as it didn‚Äôt work in my dash cam. Never had issues with other Amazon basic products"
