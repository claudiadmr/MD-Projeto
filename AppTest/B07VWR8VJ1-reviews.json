I have not bothered to apply for a refund because I JUST KNOW that \"they\" will say it is my fault.Next time I will pay the extra bucks for a decent timer."

Does the job well and efficiently. good to see Toshiba back in the market place for basic cooking/ warming up etc..had a Toshiba microwave which lasted for 28 years without losing power but gave it away for one which fitted into my new kitchen. Toshiba used to cook with no cold spots meaning some microwaves cooked unevenly even expensive makes so not suitable for cooking a sponge cake I am looking forward to trying this one. It is so easy to use."
