This is an honest account in the year in the life of a genuine hard working team boss who loves, hates, laughs and cried F1. And wants to share it. Shame more of the bosses can't be so open and honest and non politically correct!!"

Reading it in Guenthers voice makes it so much better.Up to the middle of the book is most interesting because it\u2019s new and untold, however as the book progresses it seems to dry up and less is said in each diary entry. I think the diary format really downplays the book.Overall, the book is fascinating, funny and touching. Definitely worth the read, but does dry out towards the end"

            "body": "The book was a present from someone who knows I am a massive fan of F1 and especially some of its main characters like Guenther, who is somewhat different to more reserved people in his position. Anyway, despite the profanity, which there is a lot of, it is an excellent read and insight into his life and other notables within the sport and, in my view, a terrific read, and certainly not for the faint-hearted. But if you want a non-glamorous approach with a gritty edge to the F1 landscape, then definitely get this and be transported to a side of the sport not normally seen."
