            "body": "Good morningI have some problems with Dynamic islandit does not work.The Pro and Pro Max versions were the first Apple smartphones to feature a new notch called Dynamic Island instead of the familiar \"bangs\". This is a software solution, now part of the UI, but it still works with glitches.It is also reported that when you hold your finger down on Dynamic Island, the clipped area expands but remains empty. Another issue is that Dynamic Island may not respond to touch if no apps are running in the background. Also, not everyone appreciates that the cutout remains visible in screenshots.Thanks in advance.Mr Butot"

Phone screen was flickering on and off called them they said can't replace the phone only can repair it. only had the phone for about 4 days so It was under the 14 days return and replace product but they wouldn't let me return it only option I had was to get a brand new phone repaired. So if anyone wants a iPhone best go to apple direct not like these places."

The camera and new features above the iPhone 13 are really amazing.It operates with high speed and increased efficiency relative to the iPhone 12/13 and so definitely worth the upgrade.Battery life is fairly okay - it\u2019s an iPhone so doesn\u2019t last super long in general but it\u2019s good for an iPhone!Face recognition works as it should and I have no complaints there.The size works well for me, I decided against the pro max as I didn\u2019t want a huge phone but the pro is the perfect size and oh my the colour! The purple is magnificent I adore it!Overall, just get it."
