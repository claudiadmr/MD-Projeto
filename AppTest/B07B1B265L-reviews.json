Added benefit of using the canon app to transfer pictures to my iPhone rather then the PC. Hopefully capture some great shots with this camera."

I always love taking photos on my phone, and I wanted to expand on that with this purchase.As someone who has never really held a camera like this, it feels weird to hold, I always feel like I have to be careful with it, even when I have it in it\u2019s lovely little bag/case I got for it. I will say however, having it in my hands also feels great and it feels just right. It\u2019s an odd feeling, really! It probably helps that theres the addition of the straps, but I wish there was some sort of tutorial of how to place it on in the getting started book. It baffled me for a moment or two.The quality of the images are on a whole different level compared to my phone, so thats a good thing. I love how detailed the images looked. I took practice shots and being able to see literally everything on the plushies was weird at first, but it was a good experience!In short, I am happy with the camera. The quality is great, I love having it around, and it feels quite nice to use!"

The box was open, sealed with Tape.Lens had a Smudge on it and needed a clean but I also bought a comprehensive camera care Kit so not a Prob'.Bit of a bargain price too.Online Instructions (Aren't they all?).Many Functions available. Many setings available too.Handles well in use and Buttons and Switches not to Fiddly.Going to take a while to get the hang of it, but I'm getting there.Certainly Recommend it.Very happy with my Purchase.BTW Takes Excellent Digital Photo's.As I seem to do as well."
