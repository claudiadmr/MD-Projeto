However, you can not control or customise the kids home screen anyway near enough. It\u2019s soooo cluttered and full of 100\u2019s of videos and app recommendations for kids. I wanted a \u2018blank slate\u2019 I could hand pick apps and videos. There\u2019s also no YouTube app so I can\u2019t download videos for offline viewing. Also there\u2019s no Apple TV app which is a bit crazy. The screen on the 7\u201d in terms of size is fine but it\u2019s not very sharp and everything looks a bit soft. So with all this I returned the item and bought a strong kids case for my wife\u2019s iPad Mini and will use the Guided Access feature to control navigation."

Everything in my house connected to WIFI runs great no issues but this is terrible. When kids now want to watch anything i have to download it. It still buffers even with it downloaded but at least things are watchable"
