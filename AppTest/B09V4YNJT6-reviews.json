Everything else is great, with the exception of the battery life. Yes, I use my phone a lot, but I'd hope the battery would last 24 hours. It doesn't. I usually find myself putting mine on charge by the evening. I do have a second iPhone SE which gets a lot less use. That one does easily last 24 hours, so it is down to usage.Recommended."

This included Curry\u2019s.Getting this next day was fastest option.Phone itself is great and smaller than most new phones so fits into your pocket easily.Only downside was battery life was disappointing. If you put it in battery saver mode it\u2019s ok otherwise it doesn\u2019t last a day and I\u2019m not a heavy user."

            "body": "First of all, here\u2019s what you get in the box: 1x iPhone SE (3rd generation 2022), 1x USB-C lightning cable, 1x small tool (for opening SIM card drawer), 1x Apple leaflet.You know, I\u2019m one of those guy\u2019s who is reluctant to let go of something that still functions perfectly well - which was the case when it came my iPhone 5s, which I\u2019d been happily using for over nine years. However, it did eventually have two distinct drawbacks when compared to this 3rd generation iPhone SE in that (a) I couldn\u2019t install the latest version of iOS and (b) that onscreen small keyboard was fiddly to use. So, I decided to treat myself to a suitable iPhone upgrade. All I wanted was an iPhone that was slightly larger than my old one, which incorporated the latest technology, had a very good camera, DID NOT have face recognition, would sync with my iPad, and which had functions that were familiar to me - the iPhone SE ticked all those boxes. I\u2019m a bit of a technophobe, so I initially got myself all worked up and stressed out about setting this new phone up, if you\u2019re of a similar mindset, then please don\u2019t panic because it really is a straight forward process. The Apple website has a quick and easy set-up guide, or you can refer to the many online videos demonstrating how to do so. From the point of taking my IPhone SE out of its box to the stage where I had my new phone working as it should took me in the region of 30 minutes. I\u2019m not going to outline the full procedure for setting this phone up, but based on my experience, I thought I\u2019d highlight a few things for those like me who are upgrading their iPhone. So here goes\u2026Make sure your old and new phone are connected to a power source, and that they\u2019re obviously both switched on. Have the phones sitting side by side, and connected to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Follow the instructions on your phone. Have your Apple ID code and your credit card 3-digit security code at hand. Choose how to transfer your data (via iCloud or direct from your old phone - I went for the second option). When transfer process is complete you can take the SIM card out of your old phone and slide it into the new one (this will place your mobile network, your telephone number and your contact numbers within your new phone). I\u2019m well impressed with mine because it\u2019s user-friendly, not too bulky to carry around on my person, takes beautiful photos, and syncs perfectly with my iPad (this is particularly important to me because I need the flexibility of writing/updating my daily notes on either device). Given my positive experiences of using this product, this is a mobile phone I have no hesitation recommending."
