            "body": "The G9 has been a revelation. I bought it as a cheaper way into birding photography. Used with the Panasonic 100-300 II. Absolutely stunning. Then decided to try the G9 for more things. So bought the 12-60 for landscapes, using the 100-300 for tighter crops. Absolutely love it for landscapes. The high Res mode works well for 40mp and 80mp images. Added the Olympus 45mm for portraits. And the Panasonic 20mm II for street and general walk about photography. Stopped using my Sony A7R II, just enjoy using the Panasonic system far more.Worth noting that the G9 is not a small camera. Quite a bit larger than the A7 body. But the G9 is perfect in the hand. With epic controls, stunning EVF, great LCD, awesome stabilisation. Knocks spots of the Sony."

            "body": "It\u2019s probably not healthy to love a device as much as I love this camera right now! I have owned a handful of pro and semi-pro Canons over the years and still have a 5D in my possession. If all you care about is still image quality maybe your money is better spent on a used 5D with a 24-105L (though the Panny has a bigger dynamic range, more megapix, marginally better high ISO, not to mention lighter, the still images from the canon are so natural and beautiful, it\u2019s not incomparable but the canon takes consistently more beautiful pictures so far, it\u2019s a classic magical combination) but if you care about video or ergonomics at all, the Panny will blow your mind. The images are good enough, not sure I\u2019ll sell the 5D ever but the Lumix photos are good enough considering everything else you get. With the EF Speedbooster I can use my existing Canon lenses at roughly the same focal length and aperture as I\u2019m used to which further blurs any difference between the two systems. The ergonomics are a revelation - I have set it up so that in full manual mode I have literally everything I want right under my fingertips. Every time I learn something else you can do I am just squealing with glee - this evening I figured out how to set the manual white balance on the dial buttons which gives you manual WB with two quick presses of the same button - so awesome! And the video - I recommend you do budget the extra for the VLOG-L upgrade, the waveform is worth it alone IMO - 150MB 4k 10 bit 4:2:2 MOV files\u2026 it\u2019s just an incredible machine. I love it more every time I use it! If I have any criticism at all, and I know it\u2019s the way these cameras are and makes the video and a lot of other features possible (zebras, waveform, focus peaking, focus assist and everything, all super useful things that are probably worth the trade-off), but I still prefer a real glass viewfinder. My ideal would be this back panel with a real glass viewfinder. Out in the snow the other day the viewfinder wasn\u2019t rendering the image well, very flat and lifeless in the contrasty situation, not showing the golden light riding across the snow contours at all where the Canon of course was showing me exactly what my eyes could see. But the metering is accurate and the photos come out looking good, it\u2019s just the live viewfinder is a bit flat."

I also have a variety of lenses from 3D (rubbish!), macro, superzoom and tele, so you can tell I'm a fan.The G9 is definitely the best yet, but will take some learning. Luckily there's a great Lumix USA youtube channel covering all the key features and demonstrates them in use.The only feature is lacks is integrated flash, but the ones on my G5 ad G6 weren't that great, they cause red-eye and are eclipsed by any larger lens."

            "body": "Bought this as the other models on the market now are more aimed at V-Blogging and I wanted something that would specialise in stills. It's got so many features, including video, that it would take me all year to try them and review them but it's a lovely camera and dies take the most amazing stills. It's well thought out to the point of being a little too well thought out. They could get rid of some of the buttons and just have a toggle switch which would tidy the job up.Seller delivered almost a week early so very pleased with that. The only down side to the camera is the price as with all cameras and things to do with cameras they are expensive."
