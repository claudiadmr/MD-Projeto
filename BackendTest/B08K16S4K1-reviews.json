I'd guess most of the boards have been updated for 5000 series CPUs at this point now so if you get one that isn't I'd imagine it would be older stock. So keep that in mind as there's a lot of boards that require updates if you want to run 5000 CPUs. Overall great board had no real issues I'll definitely get gigabyte boards again. Very happy"
