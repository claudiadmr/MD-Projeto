            "body": "When my old tracker gave up, I was looking for a new one that would be reputable but not make me go bankrupt - I do a high-contact sport and sometimes the trackers just break down in a sudden and brutal manner. ;) After plenty of research, I decided to go with the Mi Band.First impressions - lovely packed, and the watch just feels nice regarding the quality of materials and dial proportions. The band fastening system is very handy and no need to worry it will suddenly come loose in the middle of training. Charging is lightning-fast (the magnetic charging port is so convenient compared to the trackers charging via the USB!) and the battery lasts for ages.It's surprisingly accurate - out of sheer curiosity I tested it when also being rigged to the heart monitor. ;) If you use the PAI, it vibrates when you hit the milestone, which is a nice, rewarding tidbit. Lots of workout types to chose from, the walking / running modes also have a great feature - when you're waiting at the stop lights, the workout pauses itself and then resumes when you move again.Highly water-resistant.Very easy to connect to the phone and GPS, albeit sometimes it doesn't \"catch\" elevation changes for some reason (but I'd blame it more on hiking through the spots without cell phone coverage). You can also use it with apps other than the dedicated one - it's always nice to have some choice.My only complaint is that the touch screen is a bit TOO sensitive - training gloves or even heavy rainfall can pause your workout without you noticing, or mess with some settings. It would be nice to have some sort of a lock / unlock screen feature to aid that.Overally though - a great budget fitness tracker!"
