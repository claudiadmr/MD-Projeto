Based on Which, and family recommendations, I decided to purchase this Cosori air fryer.I have always been a keen cook regularly preparing new dishes and entertaining family and friends. Since the increased cost of electricity it seemed to be the right moment to go ahead and so far I have been very pleased with it. The instructions and recipes are very clear and simplified using it for the first time, but now I am having fun adapting my own recipes I have hardly used my oven for roasting since purchasing the air fryerand feel confident that it will inevitably save us money in the long term. The only reason I havent awarded 5 stars is because I would rather like to have had a griddle incorporated, but other than that, I am well satisfied with the ease of cooking. In addition the lack of many dishes to wash afterwards and the simplicity of cleaning the air fryer components after preparing a meal is a bonus."
