I realise that could be a problem with the provider.It was getting warm. I have rarely experienced this with any other phone."

The camera is the best i have seen so far and the battery life is 5 hours longer than my previous Samsung S22. This phone is a bargain compared to the iphones and Samsungs."

Only a wire to do the transfer of everything from your old phone, which I recommend as it's 4 times faster than using Bluetooth.The fingerprint scanner is on the screen and its performance is mediocre at best. It reads the print 1 out of every 3/4 times on average.You get all your usual apps that are great.The calling performance is good like most phones at this price point.The absolute shining light of this phone is the camera and that's the main reason you would purchase it. It's fantastic."

            "body": "This phone could be brilliant but mine overheated or got really hot when just playing music while in my pocket. I later found out if you don't use the Google themes that's change the look of the icons ect ... it's less warm when in use. The standard looking android software works more efficiently. This also effected battery life a lot ,only having 9 hours use (i.e ,music with Bluetooth earphones and the odd interneting).The tensor2 chip isn't good either. It doesnt compete with the snapdragon chips that are in most phones nowadays. Also the screen in direct sunlight was quite hard to see . It's strange as the ranges off brightness are good statwise.Camera is decent and the build quality is nice but that's about it .A massive disappointment"

I have just tried it out on my pixel and got a full day and more without having to charge up . The only downside for me was the charger plug as one wasn't provided but found one online no problem and scrolling back if you come from a phone that has a button like my old one did . To take you back it takes you a little to get use to .All in all I'm so happy with my pixel device and definitely recommend if your looking for a phone that looks stylish sleek and compete to the most well known brands on the market"

            "body": "As soon as you boot up the Pixel 7 you can feel the quality of it, from the keyboard to the camera. The phone has been designed with lots of fun little quirks which vary from the usual standard fare you get from the homogeneity of smartphones these days. The camera is as good as advertised and takes crystal clear pictures with plenty of functionality for more advanced video and picture taking. I've really enjoyed using the Pixel 7 after moving over from my OnePlus 6.I deduct a star from my rating due to 2 reasons. The first being that the battery life I have found to be rather disappointing for a new phone. It will easily get you through the day if not overtaxed, but struggles if gaming, playing music via Bluetooth headphones or extensively using Google maps. No fast charge adaptability also seems like a strange omission in these days.My second issue is the fingerprint scanner which is very unreliable. I've added the thumbprint in with 3 different versions and the phone still fails to pick it up a lot of the time. Compared to the OnePlus 6 fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone which always picked up my fingerprint, this has been pretty disappointing."

While some are very user friendly others are nightmare to deal with. The fingerprint scanner is slow and doesn't work well when too much sunlight. I often end up having to use the pattern to unlock the phone.Turns out lots of the pixels are having serious battery problems. Support are nice but after speaking to them you get a refurbished replacement."
