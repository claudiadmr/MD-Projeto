The phone constantly lags, it's slow to respond to commands, and it frequently turns on and off by itself.The touch screen is unresponsive and it's frustrating to use. To make matters worse, the phone gets warm super easily, which makes it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods of time. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this Amazon product and regret purchasing the iPhone 14. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone looking for a reliable and high-performance device.\""

My husband has the same phone and these issues are prevalent with both: screen judders when scrolling; poor photo quality compared to the 11 (which he had previously), randomly opens apps which suggests touch screen super sensitivity. It\u2019s fast though and the battery lasts about 14 hours."

The camera is of good quality but the Pro/Pro Max cameras are a lot better. Ideal for the younger members of the family. I personally would recommend the Pro/Pro Max if you like taking pictures."
